  {"question": "What is the difference between descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics?","answer": "Descriptive analytics summarizes what happened in the past. Predictive analytics uses historical data to forecast future outcomes. Prescriptive analytics recommends actions to achieve desired outcomes based on predictions.","topics": ["analytics", "descriptive", "predictive", "prescriptive"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of data cleaning and why it's important.","answer": "Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in datasets. It's crucial because poor quality data leads to inaccurate analysis and misleading insights.","topics": ["data cleaning", "data quality", "preprocessing"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between structured and unstructured data?","answer": "Structured data is organized in a predefined format (like databases), while unstructured data has no predefined format (like text, images, videos). Structured data is easier to analyze but unstructured data contains more information.","topics": ["structured data", "unstructured data", "data types"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of correlation vs causation.","answer": "Correlation indicates a relationship between variables, while causation indicates that one variable directly affects another. Correlation doesn't imply causation - this is a fundamental principle in data analysis.","topics": ["correlation", "causation", "statistics"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between mean, median, and mode?","answer": "Mean is the average of all values, median is the middle value when data is ordered, and mode is the most frequently occurring value. Each provides different insights about data distribution.","topics": ["statistics", "mean", "median", "mode"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of outliers and how to handle them.","answer": "Outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations. They can be handled by removing them, transforming them, or using robust statistical methods that are less sensitive to outliers.","topics": ["outliers", "statistics", "data analysis"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?","answer": "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models to predict outcomes, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data without predefined outcomes.","topics": ["machine learning", "supervised", "unsupervised"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of overfitting in machine learning.","answer": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data. It's prevented by using validation sets, regularization, and cross-validation.","topics": ["machine learning", "overfitting", "validation"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between classification and regression?","answer": "Classification predicts categorical outcomes (classes), while regression predicts continuous numerical values. Both are types of supervised learning but serve different purposes.","topics": ["machine learning", "classification", "regression"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of feature engineering.","answer": "Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing data to improve model performance. It includes techniques like scaling, encoding categorical variables, and creating interaction terms.","topics": ["feature engineering", "machine learning", "preprocessing"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between accuracy and precision?","answer": "Accuracy measures the overall correctness of predictions, while precision measures the proportion of true positives among predicted positives. Precision is important when false positives are costly.","topics": ["metrics", "accuracy", "precision", "evaluation"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of data visualization and its importance.","answer": "Data visualization represents data graphically to reveal patterns, trends, and insights. It's important because visual representations are easier to understand than raw data and help communicate findings effectively.","topics": ["data visualization", "charts", "graphs"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?","answer": "SQL databases are relational and use structured query language, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and can store unstructured data. SQL is better for complex queries, NoSQL for scalability and flexibility.","topics": ["databases", "sql", "nosql"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of A/B testing.","answer": "A/B testing compares two versions of something to determine which performs better. It's used to make data-driven decisions about changes to websites, products, or processes.","topics": ["a/b testing", "experimentation", "statistics"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between population and sample?","answer": "Population is the entire group being studied, while sample is a subset of the population used for analysis. Samples must be representative to draw valid conclusions about the population.","topics": ["statistics", "population", "sample"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of hypothesis testing.","answer": "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method to determine if there's enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis. It involves setting significance levels and calculating p-values to make decisions.","topics": ["statistics", "hypothesis testing", "p-value"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between parametric and non-parametric tests?","answer": "Parametric tests assume data follows a specific distribution (like normal), while non-parametric tests make no such assumptions. Non-parametric tests are more robust but less powerful.","topics": ["statistics", "parametric", "non-parametric"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of data mining.","answer": "Data mining is the process of discovering patterns and relationships in large datasets. It combines statistics, machine learning, and database systems to extract useful information from data.","topics": ["data mining", "patterns", "discovery"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between batch processing and real-time processing?","answer": "Batch processing handles data in groups at scheduled intervals, while real-time processing handles data immediately as it arrives. Real-time is faster but more complex and resource-intensive.","topics": ["data processing", "batch", "real-time"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of data governance.","answer": "Data governance is the overall management of data availability, usability, integrity, and security. It includes policies, procedures, and standards for data management across an organization.","topics": ["data governance", "management", "policies"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between ETL and ELT?","answer": "ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) transforms data before loading into a data warehouse, while ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) loads raw data first and transforms it later. ELT is more flexible for big data.","topics": ["etl", "elt", "data pipeline"]}
