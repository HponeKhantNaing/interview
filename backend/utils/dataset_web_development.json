  {"question": "What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?","answer": "HTML is more flexible and forgiving with syntax, while XHTML is stricter and follows XML rules. XHTML requires all tags to be properly closed, attributes to be quoted, and elements to be properly nested. XHTML is more structured but HTML5 is more commonly used today.","topics": ["html", "xhtml", "markup", "web development"]},
  {"question": "Explain the CSS box model and its components.","answer": "The CSS box model consists of content, padding, border, and margin. Content is the actual content area, padding is the space between content and border, border is the visible boundary, and margin is the space outside the border. The total width/height includes all these components.","topics": ["css", "box model", "layout", "web development"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between display: block, inline, and inline-block?","answer": "Block elements take full width and create line breaks, inline elements only take necessary width and don't create line breaks, inline-block combines both - takes necessary width but respects height/margin/padding like block elements.","topics": ["css", "display", "layout", "web development"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of CSS Grid vs Flexbox.","answer": "CSS Grid is for two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns), while Flexbox is for one-dimensional layouts (either row or column). Grid is better for complex layouts, while Flexbox is better for component alignment and distribution.","topics": ["css", "grid", "flexbox", "layout"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?","answer": "localStorage persists data until explicitly cleared, while sessionStorage persists data only for the duration of the page session (until tab is closed). Both store data as strings and have similar APIs but different persistence behavior.","topics": ["javascript", "localstorage", "sessionstorage", "browser storage"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of event bubbling and event capturing.","answer": "Event bubbling propagates events from the target element up to the root, while event capturing propagates from the root down to the target. The addEventListener method can control the phase using the third parameter (true for capture, false for bubble).","topics": ["javascript", "events", "bubbling", "capturing", "dom"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?","answer": "GET requests are used to retrieve data and are idempotent, while POST requests are used to submit data and can change server state. GET parameters are visible in URL, while POST data is sent in request body. GET has length limitations, POST doesn't.","topics": ["http", "get", "post", "api", "web development"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).","answer": "CORS is a security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain. It's handled by setting appropriate headers on the server (Access-Control-Allow-Origin). Preflight requests are sent for complex requests to check server permissions.","topics": ["cors", "security", "web development", "api"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between cookies and localStorage?","answer": "Cookies are sent with every HTTP request and have expiration dates, while localStorage is only accessible via JavaScript and persists until cleared. Cookies have size limitations (~4KB), while localStorage can store more data (~5-10MB).","topics": ["cookies", "localstorage", "browser storage", "web development"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of responsive design and media queries.","answer": "Responsive design makes web pages render well on various devices and screen sizes. Media queries use @media rules to apply different styles based on device characteristics like screen width, height, and orientation.","topics": ["responsive design", "media queries", "css", "web development"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript?","answer": "Synchronous code executes sequentially and blocks execution, while asynchronous code allows other operations to run while waiting for I/O or network requests. Async code uses callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle non-blocking operations.","topics": ["javascript", "synchronous", "asynchronous", "callbacks", "promises"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of the Virtual DOM in React.","answer": "The Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the real DOM. React uses it to optimize updates by comparing the virtual DOM with the real DOM and only updating the parts that changed, reducing expensive DOM manipulations.","topics": ["react", "virtual dom", "javascript", "web development"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between client-side and server-side rendering?","answer": "Client-side rendering (CSR) renders content in the browser using JavaScript, while server-side rendering (SSR) renders content on the server before sending to browser. SSR improves SEO and initial load time, while CSR provides better interactivity.","topics": ["ssr", "csr", "rendering", "web development"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of progressive web apps (PWAs).","answer": "PWAs are web apps that provide native app-like experience using features like service workers, web app manifests, and offline functionality. They can be installed on devices and work offline, providing better user experience than traditional web apps.","topics": ["pwa", "service workers", "web development", "offline"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?","answer": "HTTPS is HTTP over SSL/TLS encryption, providing secure communication between client and server. HTTPS encrypts data in transit, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring data integrity. Modern web development requires HTTPS for security.","topics": ["http", "https", "ssl", "tls", "security"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of web accessibility (a11y).","answer": "Web accessibility ensures websites are usable by people with disabilities. It includes semantic HTML, proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and color contrast. Accessibility is both a legal requirement and good practice.","topics": ["accessibility", "a11y", "semantic html", "aria", "web development"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between REST and GraphQL?","answer": "REST uses multiple endpoints for different resources, while GraphQL uses a single endpoint with queries to specify exactly what data is needed. GraphQL provides more flexibility and reduces over-fetching/under-fetching of data.","topics": ["rest", "graphql", "api", "web development"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of web performance optimization.","answer": "Web performance optimization includes techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, minification, compression, caching, and CDN usage. Performance affects user experience, SEO, and conversion rates.","topics": ["performance", "optimization", "web development", "caching"]},
  {"question": "What is the difference between state and props in React?","answer": "State is managed within a component and can change over time, while props are read-only data passed from parent to child. State triggers re-renders when changed, while props are used for component communication and configuration.","topics": ["react", "state", "props", "javascript", "web development"]},
  {"question": "Explain the concept of web security best practices.","answer": "Web security includes HTTPS, input validation, output encoding, secure headers, CSRF protection, XSS prevention, and regular security updates. Security should be built into the development process, not added as an afterthought.","topics": ["security", "web development", "https", "validation", "xss", "csrf"]}
